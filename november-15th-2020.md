  - spent some time learning more about [[nix]] today. horrible ux but incredible tech
    - some of the highlights of today's deep dive
      - you can use [[shopify/comma]] to run pretty much any program ever as easily as `, <some-prog>` without installing `<some-prog>`!
      - [[nixery]] is amazing: generates docker images **on the fly** that have pretty much any piece of software you can think of pre-installed
  - spent some time investigating [[athens]]
    - it's coming along nicely! block refs and page links all seem to work as expected. 
    - no way to import an existing roam graph for now though, so not gonna spend more time on it until that's ready
